# CAPSTONE PROJECT GIT IMPLEMENTATION

# Greenwood-library-website

In this project, I exhibited the knowledge and application of git version control, with focus on branching, merging, and conflict resolution.
I developed a dummy website with minimal content for a library, with HTML. Below are the steps i took:

## STEP 1 - Creation of Repository and Content

I created a repository on github titled "greenwood-library-website", which I cloned to my local machine. Using VScode editor, I added the homepage for the website, events page, contact page, and about page. In each of these is a line of HTML for content purpose. 

## STEP 2 - Commit and Push Changes 

Using the VScode terminal, the command "git add ." which means all changes made will be staged, ready for a commit command. This is eventually pushed to github with the "git push" command.

## STEP 3 - Branching

I created a branch for Morgan to implement his addition to the project: book_reviews. A new branch termed "add-book-reviews" was created by Morgan to add his content. Afterwards, these changes were pushed to github. Hence, the need for a pull request by assessing his changes and merging them into the project.

These images shows the changes made by Morgan about to be compared and merged into the project.

Same process was repeated for Jamie to add the update-events content.
